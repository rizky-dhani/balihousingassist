# Proposal: Align "Book Now" Button Height in Property Listings

## Problem
On the property listing page, the "Book Now" buttons currently have inconsistent heights. This is particularly noticeable when property names vary significantly in length, causing some property cards to have taller names that push the button further down, leading to a misaligned and unpolished user interface. This inconsistency detracts from the overall visual appeal and user experience of the property catalog.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to ensure that all "Book Now" buttons on the property listing page maintain a consistent height, regardless of the length of the property name. This will involve adjusting the CSS and potentially the HTML structure of the property cards and the button element to enforce a uniform vertical alignment.

## Impact
This change will significantly improve the visual consistency and professionalism of the property listing page, providing a more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience. It is a minor UI enhancement with no expected impact on functionality or backend systems.
